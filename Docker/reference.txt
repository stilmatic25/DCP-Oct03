-create image out of it and deploy  ???


How to do deploy using Image ?

Create Dockerfile 
Create Image out of this Dockerfile
Run that container.


Developers' perspective!

On DevOps perspective, How to achieve this???


How many VMs' needed and for wat purpose?
What are the tools tools needed?
What is the purpose of these tools and in which stage you use these tools ?

Dev-

jenkins master
slave - mvn-hello-world.war & img shd be build using docker file
qa-server

ansible controller --- Nodes :  jmaster,slave, 

image shd be ready in docker-hub

qa-server(docker)  -- create docker image 


simple approach is ::

1:
	install docker in jenkins slave 
	once be artifact is completed, build the docker image
	push the docker image to docker hub.
	
All the artifacts are maintained in the jfrog-artifactory /

mvn-hello-world.war:SNAPSHOT-v1.0
mvn-hello-world.war:SNAPSHOT-v1.1
mvn-hello-world.war:SNAPSHOT-v1.2


deploy to PROD-server 
	

mvn-hello-world.war:SNAPSHOT-v1.1   create docker image out of this and run that container in prod 


Ansible Controller :::

Fetch the artifacts from Jenkins Slave into the Ansible Controller

publish this to Artifactory repo.
Create an Docker image and publish to docker hub.



QA-Server ???

to run the container ?? docker run image


QA-Server ::::


java , python, node, .net   service 

one QA-SErver and run all type of applns using docker images 

docker run
